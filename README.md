# Godot Hangman
A hangman game written in GDScript with the Godot game engine

Inspired by (by which I mean look and feel completely ripped off from) the Loony Lips project from the 
GameDev.tv course [Discovering Godot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/discovering-godot-learn-to-code-by-making-games).
